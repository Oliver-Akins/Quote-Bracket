# Quote-Bracket
A system for determining the best quote for a stream. This was made for the [Resonym](https://resonym.com) community initially, but has since been expanded to allow the same system to run for multiple communities.

# Installation Instructions:

1. Clone the git repo to a server
2. Setup your domain to point to the server, this can be pointing through a reverse proxy like Nginx or directly at the Node server. **Note:** However you set it up, it must support HTTPS, otherwise Discord will not let you use the domain as a webhook endpoint.
3. Copy `config.template.toml` to `config.toml` and fill it out with the required information.
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `tsc`
6. Set the `ExecStart` and `WorkingDirectory` in the service file to run the equivalent of `node dist/main.js`. (the `dist` folder is generated by Typescript by transcompiling the code into Javascript)
7. Add the service file to your system's service folder.
8. Start the service
